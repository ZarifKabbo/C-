        <p class="">The C# language is the most popular language for the .NET platform, a free, cross-platform, open source development environment. C# programs can run on many different devices, from Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the cloud and everywhere in between. You can write apps for phone, desktop, and laptop computers and servers.</p>
        <p>C# is a cross-platform general purpose language that makes developers productive while writing highly performant code. With millions of developers, C# is the most popular .NET language. C# has broad support in the ecosystem and all .NET workloads. Based on object-oriented principles, it incorporates many features from other paradigms, not least functional programming. Low-level features support high-efficiency scenarios without writing unsafe code. Most of the .NET runtime and libraries are written in C#, and advances in C# often benefit all .NET developers.</p>

          <p>C, C++, and C# are three popular programming languages with their own unique features and use cases.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">C:</span>Developed in the early 1970s, C is a general-purpose, procedural programming language. It is known for its performance, efficiency, and control over system resources. C is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and for developing operating systems and compilers.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">C++:</span>Developed in the 1980s as an extension of C, C++ is a general-purpose programming language that incorporates object-oriented programming features. C++ offers high performance like C but also supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming paradigms. It is commonly used in game development, system/software development, and performance-critical applications.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">C#:</span>Developed by Microsoft in the early 2000s, C# (C-Sharp) is a modern, high-level programming language designed for developing a wide range of applications that run on the .NET framework. It is known for its simplicity, rich library support, and ease of use for developing Windows applications, web applications, and enterprise software.</li>

          <p>This chart provides a high-level overview of the differences and similarities between C, C++, and C#. Each language has its strengths and is suited to different types of projects, depending on the requirements and constraints of the task at hand.</p>
        </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header class="sec-headers">Hello world</header>
        <p>The "Hello, World" program is traditionally used to introduce a programming language. Here it is in C#:</p>
        <code>Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");</code>
        <p>The line starting with // is a single line comment. C# single line comments start with // and continue to the end of the current line. C# also supports multi-line comments. Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. The WriteLine method of the Console class, which is in the System namespace, produces the output of the program. This class is provided by the standard class libraries, which, by default, are automatically referenced in every C# program.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header class="sec-headers">Variables</header>
<p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>

In C#, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
</p>
<ul class="data">
  <li><span class="bold">int - </span>stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123</li>
  <li><span class="bold">double - </span>stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99</li>
  <li><span class="bold">char - </span>stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes</li>
  <li><span class="bold">string - </span>stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes</li>
  <li><span class="bold">bool - </span>stores values with two states: true or false</li>
  </ul>
  <p>To create a variable, you must specify the type and assign it a value:
</p>
<h4>Syntax:</h4>
<code>type variableName = value;</code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Conditionals">
        <header class="sec-headers" >Conditionals</header>
        <p>C# supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Less than: <span class="bold"><code>a < b</code></span></li>
          <li>Less than or equal to: <span class="bold"><code>a <= b</code></span></li>
          <li>Greater than: <span class="bold"><code>a > b</code></span></li>
          <li>Greater than or equal to: <span class="bold"><code>a >= b</code></span></li>
          <li>Equal to: <span class="bold"><code>a == b</code></span></li>
          <li>Not Equal to: <span class="bold"><code>a != b</code></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can use these conditions to perform different actions for different decisions.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Use <span class="bold">if </span>to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true</li>
          <li>Use <span class="bold">else </span>to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false</li>
          <li>Use <span class="bold">else if </span>to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false</li>
          <li>Use <span class="bold">switch </span>to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Syntax:</h4>
<code>if (condition) 
{</br>
  &nbsp// block of code to be executed if the condition is True
}</code>
